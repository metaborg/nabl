<!--
To consider beforehand:
- Have you read and applied the Statix debugging guide at https://www.spoofax.dev/howtos/statix/debugging/?
- Have you checked the reference documentation at https://www.spoofax.dev/references/statix/ on whether your idea of expected behavior is actually correct?
- Have you checked whether the issue is already reported. If so, consider commenting on that issue with your specific scenario, instead of opening a new issue.
